# SmallCell-Suit #


## Introduction ##

smallcell suit is a wet lab bench protocol package for profiling transcriptome and epigenomic information, namely histone modification and DNA methylation, from 1000~2000 cells. It is designed for surveying epigenetic information of “rare” cell populations in vivo at locus-specific and genome-wide scales. 

protocols includes:

 * smallcellChIP 
   
   Low input chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
   
 * smallcellRNA

   Low input RNA isolation and reverse transcription
   
 * smallcellDNAme

   Low input bisulfite conversion and Sanger Sequencing
 

## Details ##

## Installation ##


To used these protocols, you need certain equipement and reagents
